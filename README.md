# Complete JS Course's challenges solutions

This repository serves as a personal tracker for my progress on Jonas Schmedtmann's Complete JS Course on Udemy

- [Udemy Link] - Link to course

Please keep in mind that some solutions (especially the earlier ones) are not ideal because I wanted to stick to the information the course had given me at the moment each challenge was brought up, i.e., not using functions before the course had actually taught functions.
